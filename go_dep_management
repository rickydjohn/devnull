GO DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT

This generally fails while trying to do a go build or building dependencies. Solve it by adding the following git commands

1. git config --global url.ssh:url.ssh://git@github.com/.insteadOf https://github.com/
2. git config user.email "xxxx@xxxx.com"
3. git config user.name "name name"
